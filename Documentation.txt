Asset Insight Coding Challange

BACKEND:
    The task is to create a web application that produces some kind of user management functionality. 
    The application should be able to:
        Display the users in a list/table.
        Have the ability to create users.
        Have the ability to update users.
        Have the ability to delete users. 

    to build this app we will divide our application logic into structured components
    (routes → controllers → services → repositories → models)
    where each layer has a specific task

    when building this app 
    the main task at hands are:
        Spinning up correct DB structured our db is ran by docker to ensure easy access and user model contains name email and role
        building the CRUD for our users
            Get users should have pagination
            CREATE users should have appropriate VALIDATION
            PUT will have validations
            Delete will Delete
        We should have at least minimal Logging
    
    MAINTAIN CLEAN ARCHITECTURE
